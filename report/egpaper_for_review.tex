\section{Introduction/Background/Motivation}
%subsection{Motivation}
In recent years, LLM(Large Language Models) applications drew people’s attention as they have demonstrated astonishing conversational interactive experiences. Questions from the public soon follow on the capabilities of LLM, and the extent of the technology’s potential. Interestingly, many tasks that LLMs struggle with point to the same challenge, which is the limited context window. As existing language models are generally implemented with transformers, they require memory and computation resources that increase quadratically in sequence length which puts a limit on the context length. In this article, we look into this limited context window problem or similarly, how to learn from examples more efficiently, and experiment with both fine-tuning and in-context learning methods that aim at alleviating it, increasing both in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy on RTE dataset.

There are multiple investigated approaches to improve the context window limit. The first approach involves architectural changes that develops and trains models with longer context length from scratch. The other type, while keeping the architecture and pre-trained model intact, leverages the idea of adaptation and adapts the LLMs to tasks requiring longer context length. The classic adaptation methodologies, fine-tuning and in-context learning falls under this category.

There are many real-life and business use cases that could benefit from a long context window.
For example, When Google tested its Gemini 1.5 which was released February 2024, they dropped an entire codebase and asked Gemini to write documentation for it. They also showed a 45-minute movie to Gemini and asked questions about the movie. To add on to that, use cases can be reading homeworks from current and all history class sessions to locate possible plagiarisation, to read detailed customer service chat history and chat instructions to tune a customer service chatbot, to monitor the videos online, etc. Theoretically, anything that exceeds the standard context window, which is around 124k tokens for GPT-4 and LLMs alike, compiled PDF files, details instructions, movies or videos longer than 5 minutes (videos are pre-processed into frames and each frame count as 128 tokens roughly) would be challenging for current LLMs. And It will be more challenging if more than one type of data is provided, for example, have LLMs to watch a 2 hour movie and write reviews or press articles about the movie. The actual use cases have no limit.

We use RTE(Recongnizing Textual Entailment) dataset in this experimentation. The RTE datasets come from a series of textual entailment challenges. It started with “an inference test suite for evaluating the inferential competence of different NLP systems and semantic theories” called FraCas which is created manually by many linguists and funded by FP3-LRE. Later, Pascal RTE challenges, sharing a similar goal as FraCas, starts this RTE generic evaluation framework that evaluates models for distinct, real-world downstream tasks so datasets were extracted from downstream tasks through a process referred to as recasting (Glickman, 2006). This framework has impacted the community hugely and has been evolving since. The dataset we use is a combined dataset from RTE1, RTE2, RTE3 and RTE5. Examples are constructed from news and wikipedia text.

\section{Approach}

The idea we propose in this project is to apply the context distillation fine-tuning of
the natural language inference (NLI) classification task and compare it to the ICL approach. Given OPT’s fixed context size of 2048 tokens we are limited in the number of examples we can use at inference time, but the number of examples supplied are not limited during fine tuning. That is to say,  theoretically the limited context window problem can be solved by supplying those examples at the fine tuning stage. 

Now the problem becomes how to enable the  pre-trained model to learn more efficiently during fine training. We go with context distillation fine-tuning in this project and specifically look into the dynamics of KL Divergence Loss which was not discussed in the literature we went through. The details of the setup is disucssed in the experiment section.

We based our work on the llmft repo (https://github.com/uds-lsv/llmft) which was created along the Few-shot Fine-tuning vs. In-context Learning paper (Marius et al, 2023) 
On top of that, we mainly update 

- part where the prompt are generated 

- KL Divergence Loss calculation



\section{Experiments and Results}
\subsection*{Experiments}
We perform exploration on the dynamics of optimizing  KL Divergence loss, and compared ICL and FT approaches for task adaptation in NLI by their in-domain and out-of-domain performances. In the following paragraphs, we discuss our experiment setups in detail.

Models 
All experiments were run using the same OPT model (Zhang et al., 2022) with 125 million parameters, thus our results can be compared directly without other factors at play. It was also a decision made due to limited computing resources.

Loss Function

Datasets 
We converted the dataset to a specific format using a pattern and a verbalizer, and the same data is used for both ICL testing and PBFT training. For verbalizer we used 0 and 1, which can be mapped to entailment and not entailment. An example of the prompt is provided in figure.

Task: Determine the relationship between the following two sentences. Answer 0 for 'entailment', 1 for 'contradiction'.

Here are examples  to help you:
Example 1:
Sentence1: No Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq Yet.
Sentence2: Weapons of Mass Destruction Found in Iraq.
Answer:  1

Now, please answer the following question: 
Question:
Sentence1: Mangla was summoned after Madhumita's sister Nidhi Shukla, who was the first witness in the case      
Sentence2: Shukla is related to Mangla.          
Answer:

sample prompt when num of ctx examples = 1

ICL setup
[?] number of context examples are provided to ICL. We consider a prediction to be correct when the returned probability of the ground truth’s verbalizer is larger than the other verbalizer token.

FT setup 
We perform a few-shot PBFT with the simple pattern shown in the above datasets section where we expect the model to follow up with a 0 or 1 indicating the label for the test case. The number of context examples supplied are tested with different values, either 1 or 2 or 3 examples are provided. The pre-trained model is tuned with KL Divergence loss between the stored log-probabilities and the model-predicted probabilities. The number of log probabilities stored are also tested with different values, either top 5 or 10 or 50 tokens are preserved. LoRA is used as the PEFT technique to speed up the training process.


\subsection*{Results}
(10 points) How did you measure success? What experiments were used? What were the results, both quantitative and qualitative? Did you succeed? Did you fail? Why? Justify your reasons with arguments supported by evidence and data.

\textbf{Important: This section should be rigorous and thorough. Present detailed information about decision you made, why you made them, and any evidence/experimentation to back them up. This is especially true if you leveraged existing architectures, pre-trained models, and code (i.e. do not just show results of fine-tuning a pre-trained model without any analysis, claims/evidence, and conclusions, as that tends to not make a strong project). }

\section{Work Division}

Please add a section on the delegation of work among team members at the end of the report, in the form of a table and paragraph description. This and references do \textbf{NOT} count towards your page limit. An example has been provided in Table \ref{tab:contributions}.

\section{Miscellaneous Information}

The rest of the information in this format template has been adapted from CVPR 2020 and provides guidelines on the lower-level specifications regarding the paper's format.

\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.


\subsection{Paper length}
Papers, excluding the references section,
must be no longer than six pages in length. The references section
will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the
length of the references section. For example, a paper of six pages
with two pages of references would have a total length of 8 pages.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the
version submitted for review.  The ruler is provided in order that
reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without
circumlocution.  If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\
document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to
appear on the final output pages.  The presence or absence of the ruler
should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.  The
camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (\LaTeX\ users may uncomment
the \verb'\cvprfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)  Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper
--- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains
many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.  Just use fractional
references (e.g.\ this line is $095.5$), although in most cases one would
expect that the approximate location will be adequate.

\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations.  It is
important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.  Just
because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader
might not need to refer to it.  It is cumbersome to have to use
circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column
1''.  (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not
an alternative to equation numbers).  All authors will benefit from reading
Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be
found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.  For conference
submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the
reviewer to go to a techreport for further details.  Thus, you may say in
the body of the paper ``further details may be found
in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool which
is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.  For example,
let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander,
and you believe that the CVPR70 audience would like to hear about your
solution.  The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled
``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to
the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.  Don't write ``We show how to
improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].  This time we tested the
algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors. Instead
write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.  This
   system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] didn't
   handle case B properly.  Ours handles it by including
   a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo
   lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't
   you know.  It displayed the following behaviours
   which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention,
reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as
the authors.  A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was
written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been
contracted to solve problem B.

FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper. For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge. Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a
sentence-ending space. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided
\verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'',
shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.)
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.  Thus, the
following is correct: ``
   Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...''
because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.  If you use the
\verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods
when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not
chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to
\cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
$\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.



%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Figures~\ref{fig:onecol} and~\ref{fig:short}.  Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results.   Ours is better.}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}
